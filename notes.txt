4 Pillars of Object Oriented Programming
  Encapsulation
    - group related variables and functions that operate on them into objects.
    This is what is called encapsulation.
  Abstraction
    - hiding the complexity (e.g. DVD board and push buttons)
      Hide methods and properties to reduce impact of change and reduce complexity of the user interface
  Inheritance
    - allows programmer to eliminate redundant code. Allows elements to inherit   
      Object properties and methods without starting from scratch.
  Polymorphism
    - a technique allows programmer to get rid of long if and else and switch case 
      statements

Old Way - Procedural Programming
- divide a program in a set of functions
- Spaghetti code - interdepency with code

Objects - properties and methods
Topics:
    - Creating Objects
      Object literals
    - Factories and Constructors
      Factories return a new object
      Constructors return new instances of an object like classes in other languages.
    - Primitives and Reference Types
      Primitives are copied by value
      Reference types are copied by the reference or address in memory
    - Working with Properties
    - Private Properties
    - Getters/Setters
